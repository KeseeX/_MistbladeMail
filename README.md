## MistbladeMail

MistbladeMail is a powerful addon designed to streamline the process of managing items between your alts on Sheilun / Mistblade. This addon creates an alt-friendly mailbox environment, making it easier to transfer useful materials to your chosen characters.

With MistbladeMail, you can quickly send all items of a specific type — up to eight predefined categories — to selected recipients, saving you time and effort. The categories include various resources and materials such as lockboxes, ores, herbs, and more, which can quickly cause clusterf*ck in your bags.

You can access and modify these settings from the Interface Options menu or by using the **/mbmail** command directly in the chat. The addon is specifically designed to work with the 5.4 version of the game, ensuring every potentially useful item is included in the proper category.

I hope it will help you create trading/crafting empires.

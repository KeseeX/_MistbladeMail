## MistbladeMail

**MistbladeMail** is a powerful addon designed to simplify managing items between your alts on Sheilun/Mistblade. It creates an alt-friendly mailbox system that makes transferring materials between characters easier than ever. This addon is part of a larger suite of three combined addons—MistbladeMail, MistbladeVendor, and MistbladeFix—aimed at delivering a variety of quality-of-life features to the Mists of Pandaria (MoP) environment, addressing gaps that current addons fail to fill.

With MistbladeMail, you can quickly send all items of a specific type—up to eight predefined categories—to selected recipients, saving you both time and effort. These categories include common resources such as lockboxes, ores, herbs, and other materials that can easily clutter your bags.

You can access and modify these settings via the Interface Options menu or by using the /mbmail command directly in the chat. Designed specifically for the 5.4 version of the game, MistbladeMail ensures that all potentially useful items are categorized appropriately.

I hope it helps you build your trading and crafting empire more efficiently!
